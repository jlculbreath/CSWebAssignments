Lab 1

For this lab, we were to create a github account. 
Then create a repository in remote GitHub. 
Then clone it to the local machine.
Then create Source and Documentation directories locally.

Take screenshots of remote repository creation and put them in the local documentation folder.
Then sync to remote.

Then we had to create a web page documenting the process to create a repository. 
The file is in pure html, using standard tags. 
The images are in a separate folder, called 'Images'.

We were also to create a YouTube video showing how to create a repository and commit a file.
This video should be added to the web page just created in an iframe with video controls.

Then we were to sync the local and remote repositories.
